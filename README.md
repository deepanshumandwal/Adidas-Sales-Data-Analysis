The data was sourced from Kaggle

**Features and Highlights**

**Charts and Graphs Used**

- Area Chart (Total Sales by Month)	Chosen to clearly show sales trends over time, highlighting seasonality and growth/decline patterns in a continuous manner.
- Donut Chart (Total Sales by Region)	Selected for its effectiveness in visualizing proportions and distribution of total sales across the distinct geographical regions (West, South, etc.).
- Stacked Bar Chart (Sales by Product)	Used to compare the contribution of individual products to the overall sales total, instantly showcasing the dominance of Men's Street Footwear.
- Stacked Bar Chart (Sales by Retailer)	Employed to rank retailers by total sales, immediately identifying top-performing retail partners like West Gear.

**Business Problem Solved**

The project addressed the need for a clear, centralized, and real-time understanding of sales performance. By consolidating raw transactional data, the dashboard allows stakeholders (like sales managers) to quickly identify which products and retailers drive the most profit, enabling data-driven decisions on inventory, marketing spend allocation, and partnership focus.
